Description:
Supplementary S1: nullclines and vector field for an earlier, 
monostable energetic model without nonlinear energy amplification.
Supplementary S2: bifurcation-style scan for a feedback-only 
model lacking nonlinear energy restoration, showing a single 
equilibrium branch across a wide range of axonal loads A.
