# **Significance Statement**

Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra are uniquely vulnerable in Parkinson’s disease, yet the reason for this selective degeneration has remained unclear. We show that a **minimal two-variable energetic model**—capturing only mitochondrial capacity, energy availability, and structural load—naturally generates a **saddle-node tipping point**. SNc neurons, with their exceptionally large axonal arbors and high calcium-handling demand, operate near this tipping point, while VTA neurons do not. This simple geometric mechanism reproduces key features of Parkinsonian vulnerability: long periods of stability, sudden irreversible collapse, and population-specific susceptibility. The results suggest that **anatomical load alone**, rather than disease-specific molecular defects, may place SNc neurons near an energetic boundary that predisposes them to degeneration, offering a unifying perspective for understanding and potentially mitigating selective neuronal loss.
